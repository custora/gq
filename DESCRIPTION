Description: A set of functions to compute integrals using Gaussian quadrature.
  Limits can be passed as vectors. The functions just do a straightforward 
  quadrature approximation, with no numerical optimization to compute the 
  optimal value within a tolerance. This is more for when you need vectorized
  limits and you prefer speed over accuracy (we originally wrote these for
  computing integrals in maximum likelihood).
