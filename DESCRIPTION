Description: A set of functions to compute integrals using Gaussian quadrature.
    Limits can be passed as vectors. The functions just do a straightforward
    quadrature approximation, with no numerical optimization to compute the
    optimal value within a tolerance. This is more for when you need vectorized
    limits and you prefer speed over accuracy (we originally wrote these for
    computing integrals in maximum likelihood).
